Hi, I am Jason Bowman. I am a Senior Engineering major at Harvey Mudd College, with a concentration in Russian language.
I am in Micro Ps to expand my software knowledge and learn skills in computer hardware that will hopefully shape my 
career and general engineering technical and professional skills.
